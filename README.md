* models definition path - path to the JSON file containing the definition of the models to be executed.


## Background

Machine Learning is now more present than ever in our society. It completly changed the game for various industry sectors, and if you're not making any use of it, you're probably going to stay behind.

However, machine learning isn't easy to understand and hard to use as writting code for it can be a pain in the ass, but ideally, **everyone should be able to benefit from this type of techonology, even if you don't know how to write a single line of code**!

This is where *MLhub* comes into place.


## Features

### Low code machine learning

*MLhub* allows you to train multiple machine learning models, for regression and classification problems, without writing a single line of code. In fact, the only thing you need is a JSON file where you define the location of your datasets and the models that you want to test. Then you just need to wait for some *MLhub* magic happening behind the scenes ‚ú®.

### Auto Machine learning

*MLhub* gives you the freedom to fully customize your models, in case you know what you're actually doing, or you can also just pick your model and leave the rest to us (like in the example above)! 

If you want to costumize them, you should be able to use any parameter that is used in the [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) models. Here's an example for a [Decision Tree Regressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html):

### Train and Benchmarks models

Our tool allows you to automatically train models and provide you results that allow you to evaluate their performance. For **regression problems** we measure metrics such as *r2 score*, *mean squared error* and *mean absolute error*. For **classification problems** we measure metrics such as *accuracy*, *precision*, *recall* and *f1 score*. In both cases we also measure the *CPU time* so that you also have some information about performance.


### Report Generation

For each model that you have defined on your JSON file, we provide you two *python notebooks* (one that was executed already and one that wasn't), with everything that we ran behind the scenes, so you can understand what happened and modify something if you want.

We also generate a CSV file and special report that hold a statistical comparison between the different models.

## Future Work

* Support more models (e.g. neural networks).
* Support more types of problems (e.g. image classification).
* Have more Auto ML features (e.g. perform grid search to find the best parameters for each model).
* Build a user interface to provide an alternative for composing the JSON input file.
